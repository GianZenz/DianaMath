# Student Avatar Images

Please save student avatar images in this folder with the following names:

- `student_avatar_1.png` - A friendly cartoon student (maybe with glasses)
- `student_avatar_2.png` - A student with curly hair
- `student_avatar_3.png` - A student with different skin tone
- `student_avatar_4.png` - A student with different hairstyle
- `student_avatar_5.png` - A student with different characteristics

These should be child-friendly cartoon-style avatars that represent diverse students learning math. Each should be approximately the same size as diana_cartoon.png (around 64x64 pixels or similar).

For now, these will fall back to diana_cartoon.png if the files don't exist.
